\*\* April 7,2023
Using the the endpoints that I sent last time from jsonplacehoders.
Create an app that contains 2 pages:
  -Home page
  -Users page
And a header that contains links to navigate between those page
In home page i want to see:
A page that lists all posts as cards.
An input filters posts by title field.
  When clicking on a post, takes me to post details page. ( use react-router-dom) to perform navigation.
Adding a post to your favorite list. (Using local storage to persist favorite posts).
In users page I wanna see two columns:
Left column shows list of users in a table.
Right column shows user details when clicking on a user ( row of the table).
By ending this excercice, you have to explain:
 the different hooks that you use .
And difference between props and state .   


/***

 *  git add . (add all changes to staging ) staging => files to be committed
 *
 *  git commit -m "adding new features"
 *
 *  git push (git push origin main)
 */
